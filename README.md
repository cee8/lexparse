# Java Lexer and Parser

This project implements a lexer and parser in Java, designed to tokenize and parse a simplified programming language. The lexer breaks down the input code into a series of tokens, which the parser then analyzes to understand the structure and syntax of the code.

## Overview

The lexer and parser work together to process code written in a custom, simplified programming language. The lexer identifies and categorizes each piece of the input as tokens, such as keywords, identifiers, and operators. The parser then takes these tokens and builds a parse tree, ensuring the code follows the defined grammar of the language.

## Features

- **Lexer**: Tokenizes input code into identifiable tokens.
- **Parser**: Analyzes tokens to validate the syntax and structure.
- **Error Handling**: Provides informative error messages for syntax errors.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Allows users to input code directly for parsing.
